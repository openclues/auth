## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

- `POST /register/`: Register a new user.
- `POST /auth/token/login/`: Login to obtain an access token.
- `POST /auth/token/logout/`: Logout and invalidate the access token.
- `POST /password/reset/`: Request a password reset by providing your email address.
- `POST /password/reset/confirm/{uid}/{token}/`: Confirm the password reset using the UID and token received in the email.
- `POST /activate/{uid}/{token}/`: Confirm email verification using the UID and token received in the email.

## Authentication and Authorization

TokenAuthProject uses token-based authentication. Users can obtain an access token by logging in with their credentials. This token is then used for subsequent API requests to authenticate the user.

To access protected endpoints, you need to include the access token in the request headers:

```
Authorization: Token <access_token>
```
